#A Java Book-Lending Application Project (With Tests)
This project is a result of my work going through [Mark Dexter's tutorial series on Eclipse and Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUGinutrSzN97XcdPgNUI3HB9Tjwvdl_r). While I've done lots of web development work and obj c programming, this is the first time I've fired up Eclipse and tried to make something in Java. Also my first use of test-driven development.

#Progress: 16/16
I've completed all the lessons in this tutorial series and created a small book-borrowing application using test-driven development. The final program is built in build/LibraryApplication.jar. There is no GUI, but when ran, the program will spit out a few library transactions and its status after each one.

#Things I Loved About Eclipse
* Eclipse autocomplete!
* Smart refactoring for renaming variables, classes, etc
* Eclipse scrapbook for playing with chunks of code
* QuickFix makes it easy to write a failing test, then have Eclipse define the functions necessary for it to pass :D
* Extract Function makes it easy to remove duplicated code and replace it all with method calls to a single new function.

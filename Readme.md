#A Java Book-Lending Application Project (With Tests)
This project is a result of my work going through [Mark Dexter's tutorial series on Eclipse and Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUGinutrSzN97XcdPgNUI3HB9Tjwvdl_r). While I've done lots of web development work and obj c programming, this is the first time I've fired up Eclipse and tried to make something in Java. Also my first use of Test-Driven Development.

#Things I'm Loving About Eclipse
* Eclipse autocomplete!
* Really smart refactoring for renaming variables, classes, etc
* Eclipse scrapbook for playing with chunks of blocks of code
* Eclipse QuickFix makes it easy to write a failing test, then have Eclipse define the functions necessary for it to pass :D

#Progress: 13/16
Wrote test for getBooksForPerson method -- need it to satisfy maximumBooks requirement of checkOut method. Finished Lesson 13.

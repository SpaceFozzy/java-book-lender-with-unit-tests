#A Java Book-Lending Application Project (With Tests)
This project is a result of my work going through [Alex Taylor's tutorial series on Eclipse and Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUGinutrSzN97XcdPgNUI3HB9Tjwvdl_r). While I've done lots of web development work and obj c programming, this is the first time I've fired up Eclipse and tried to make something in Java. Also my first use of Test-Driven Development.

#Things I'm Loving About Eclipse
* Eclipse autocomplete!
* Really smart refactoring for renaming variables, classes, etc
* Eclipse scrapbook for playing with chunks of blocks of code

#Progress
Just wrote passing JUnit tests, finished Lesson 5.
